# Edgless Master Thesis Code

# Overview

Edgless is a system that leverages serverlss functions deployed in an edge environment. The purpose of Edgless is to explore the throughput performance from serverless functions when deployed in the cloud, and at the edge. Hence, the system is built using multiple AWS components, including Greengrass, Lambda functions and S3. This repository contains the major comopnents that are used in Edgless. For the evaluations, there are two different setups, one done in the cloud and one for the edge. As a result, the directory structure of this repository will adhere to these environments. Each of these setups will have their own deployment mechanism, therefore more details can be found in the READM.md of each of the directories of this repository.
